        "message": "I bought StackFood thinking it was the best restaurant system on CodeCanyon, and even though I installed it without any issues, it was impossible to translate due to errors. Additionally, the Flutter version was not very appealing, and to top it off, the support was poor, and they charged for everything. So, I decided to buy FoodKing as an emergency solution, and what a surprise! It's spectacular! I was able to translate it without any problems, and the platform has everything a restaurant chain needs to operate online. Oh, I almost forgot, the design is beautiful!!! I couldn't be happier, and the support is excellent. Thank you very much.",
